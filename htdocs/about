  <h2>About Matt</h2>
  <p>
  After a bachelor's degree in physics, I started a career as an actuary in life insurance.
  I've worked in experience studies, product development, and software sales via proof-of-concept demos.
  In the middle of my five years in insurance, I briefly left to bootstrap a webapp with the vision to build a community of people cultivating better habits.

  Covid got me thinking about my priorities, and I decided to take another hiatus in 2021.
  In the last two years, I've learned how to sail (highlight: a 2,000-mile round trip between NYC and Nova Scotia), built a tiny house with my friends, and spent a lot of time climbing at the rock gyms in Orlando and Tokyo.
  Now I'm ready for a fresh start in a new field, focusing this time on meaningful work rather than cushy-as-possible work.
