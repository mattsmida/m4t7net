    <h2>In a breath or two</h2>
    <p> I've done particle physics research,
        sold actuarial software to Fortune 100s,
        found FIRE just, <em>meh</em>,
        didn't get seriously injured helping build my tiny house,
        sailed to Canada while dying in less than 1% of multiverse timelines,
        and climbed my way to a  <em>shodan</em> badge at Noborock in Tokyo.

    <h2>How to live?</h2>
    <p>
      While I was in Tokyo back in July, I spent a bunch of time thinking and writing about what I've done so far.
      Trying to figure out how to live.
      Seems like the answer will keep changing.
      Maybe that's okay.
